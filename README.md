# Undergrad Women In Tech Resources

This is a list of resources that I have compiled for undergrad women in tech.  They are all based on personal experience and things that I have learnt along the way in my three years of undergrad at the University of Washington.  This is by no means a comprehensive list nor am I affiliated with any of the organizations listed below.

## Internship Resources

_DISCLAIMER: These internship resources are geared towards software engineering._

**NOTE: Many of these internship resources are not specifically targeted at solely women in tech.  These opportunities are widely applied to specific groups such as university underclassmen, black / latinx communities etc.**

There are a lot of internship resources for minorities as companies want to support you. These are all great ways to get your foot in the door into some large companies.

## My Advice

Over the last three years, I have learnt a lot about navigating the tech space, especially as a women / minority.  My two biggest pieces of advice are the following:

* **Stay Strong**: While tech is a booming space to be in currently, it's not easy navigating it all alone.  Imposter syndrome is _very_ real and it's often something people don't talk about a lot. As you navigate your undergrad, try your best to stay strong, remember that everyone doesn't have it as well as it seems and that in time, you too will find your footing.

* **Turn being a minority into an advantage**: There are a lot of resources and opportunities out there for women / minoritites that others might not have access to.  People want you to succeed and are willing to help you in most ways possible.  Take advantage of that, turn being a minority into a positive experience.
